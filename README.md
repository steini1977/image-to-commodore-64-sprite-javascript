# image-to-commodore-64-sprite-javascript
[New improved version on my web page steini1977.github.io]
Javascript with html to make spritedata from image files (jpg/png/gif) (tiff does not go well in this)
You might have to drop the image on the gray field, twice.
msprt.js is the java skript file (must be in the same folder that msprt.html is.
sprt.js is also java skript file (must be in the same folder that sprt.html is.
All scripts is tested in Google Chrome internet browser. The results might be different in other browsers.
Skripts used in this project is p5js and javascripts language(html is a browser file).
work best with images that are rich with red,green,blue colours. Black becomes transculiant.
Good luck.
UPDATE:
New files are uploaded, old is removed
index.html is the main-file to open.
